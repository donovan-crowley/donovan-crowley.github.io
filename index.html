        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          This project aimed to build a drone to compete for the VFS Competition, focusing on agility, speed, payload capacity, and precise payload dropping.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          First, I developed a Hough Circle Transform algorithm to detect circular edges in the images from the ESP32 camera.
          Then, with the microcontroller, I incorporated a servo motor with the ESP32 to drop specific payloads on command aimed at this location.
          <br><br>
          I soldered the components shown in the schematic below to assemble six circuit boards to build connections between the Pixhawk and each of the six motors on the drone.

        <p>Our team won <b style = "color:white; font-weight: bold">3rd place</b> 
        in the Novice Division at the 2023 Lime Rock Park Electrathon Competition</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>We built an electric vehicle from scratch for an endurance competition, developing a car that could go the most distance in an hour.</p>
        <h2>Important Components</h2>
        <li>Two 12V Yellow Top Optima lead-acid batteries, providing a total voltage of 24V for high specific energy</li>
        <li>Alltrax Motor Controller</li>
        <li>DC Motor with 2800 RPM</li>
        <li>Bicycle Disc Brakes</li>
        <br>

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <li>Fusion 360 & 3D Printer to design and print parts that protected the electrical components and connected awkward pieces such as the mirrors and fan</li>
        <li>Soldering iron to connect electronics</li>
        <li>Hot glue gun, string, and tape to connect parts to the chassis</li>
        <li>Digital multimeter to measure voltage, current, and resistance at different parts of the circuit</li>
        <br>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>While originally tasked with developing the foundations of the vehicle including the chassis, mirrors, throttle, brakes, steering wheel, and chair, 
          I ran into problems with the electrical system. 
          <br><br>
          Seeing this challenge would eventually need to be overcome, 
          I spearheaded the development of the circuit design. The given schematic for the motor controller appeared to be incorrect,
          so I researched, tested, and implemented my own adaptation inspired by the original to power the vehicle.
        </p>
        <img src = "images/Car2.jpg" alt = "Car Schematic" loading = "lazy" class = "modal-img"/>
        <br>

        <h2>Circuit</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest loop in the circuit was connecting the controller pins to the potentiometer that controls the throttle as shown in the original schematic.
          The rest of the circuit was not as easy, and we could never produce power to rotate the motor sprocket following the original.
          <br><br>
          So, I continuously redesigned and tested the schematic until I found my final design, as shown above, that incorporated a brake light and display monitor.
          Once the vehicle was able to run, we focused on perfecting the other aspects.
        </p>

        <h2>Calculations</h2>
        <p>For the endurance aspect of the competition, we looked to maximize our performance by analyzing the weight and energy cost of the vehicle.
          <br><br>
          The competition required that the minimum weight of the driver with additional weight to the vehicle must be 80kg. 
          Since both drivers were under 80kg, we stacked our motor, batteries, and all the electronics in the back and added our ballast to the front.
          This distribution proved advantageous, allowing the vehicle to better climb the hills in the course.
          <br><br>
          We stayed around 30-40mph throughout the entire race to conserve energy and maintain a relatively fast speed. 
          We used more energy to climb hills and on the straight-aways than while turning or descending.
          <br><br>
          I measured the center-to-center distance between the motor and wheel to be about 16", ensuring little slack with the gear chain.
          Through online research, I determined a 6:1 motor-to-sprocket ratio to be most efficient for the endurance, turns, and hills of the competition.

        <h2>Web Scraper</h2>
      </div>
      <div class = "modal-body">
        <p>I built a web scraper using Puppeteer from the Node.js library, which provides an API for controlling headless Chrome and Chrome browsers
          and Cheerio, which has jQuery-like features, to parse HTML and manimulate DOM on the server side.
          <br><br>
          Currently, the web scraper extracts basic information such as weather and a daily quote, and I looked to develop a more complex implementation.
          <br><br>
          The Wiki Game contains a popular problem that searches for the shortest path between pages on Wikipedia using internal links.
          My initial implementation included the Puppeteer and Cheerio installations, but the process of opening, reading, and closing browser instances was slow and inefficient.
          <br><br>
          Thus, I transitioned to use Wikipedia's public API with Axios to fetch page data directly and extrapolate internal links using a breadth-first search approach.
          The process still takes a considerable amount of time, yet it is much faster than my initial approach. 
          Also, it's important to ensure the start and end links exist before the code fetches multiple Wikipedia pages, skipping the desired end.
          <br><br>
          Then, I switched to Python to implement the SentenceTransformer pretrained language model. 
          Additionally, I switched to an A* search to embed each link and use cosine similarity to compare the links based on the given end goal with the SentenceTransformers library.
          A higher cosine similarity meant the link was was semantically closer to the goal and that link would be pushed to the top of a priority-queue to be analyzed further.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        Developed a real-time object tracking algorithm in C++ using OpenCV. 
        The program captures live video from a webcam using OpenCV's VideoCapture, detects circular objects, learns the object's color characteristics, and tracks the object frame by frame.
        </p>
        <h2>SEARCH</h2>
        <p>
          The default search mode converts the frames to grayscale and detects objects using the Hough Circle Transform.
        </p>
        <h2>TRAIN</h2>
        <p>
          Once a target is found, the train mode is deployed by typing the key "t" on the computer.
          The algorithm samples pixels inside and outside the circle to calculate the average HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values for color boundaries.
          The program iteratively adjusts the thresholds to maximize the difference between the internal and external color values of the circle.
          When the optimal threshold is found, the program automatically transitions into the tracking mode.
        </p>
        <h2>TRACK</h2>
        <p>
          Using the learned HSV range to create a binary mask, the tracking mode applies morphological operations to reduce noise and focus on the object to track.
          The programs tracks the center of the object using image moments and traces a line to display the objects movement.
        </p>
        <h2>READ</h2>
        <p>
          I used the read mode more for the development of the project to familiarize myself with OpenCV HSV values.
          This mode calculates the hue, saturation, and value within a particular fixed region to display real-time color values.
